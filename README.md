## OrderedTrait
*Based on concepts of Ordered trait properties*<br>
**Used upper bound concepts of scala**<br>
**Create a case class number for element type because oredered trait library don't support such as Int, Double,
or String are not subclasses of Ordered, so values of these types cannot be used as
set elements directly in subtyping**
